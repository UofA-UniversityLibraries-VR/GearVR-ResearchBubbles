Developed by the University of Adelaide, University Libraries [VR Project](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/projects/vr/)


Description
-----------
A simple project to demonstrate the process of developing VR experiences for the GearVR (and other Virtual Reality platforms) and to highlight the low barrier of entry.

The project uses only blue prints and pre-existing assets (aside from the BeachBall texture; which was developed as 200x200 png files in GIMP), and was developed in approximately 8 days by an amateur.

Due to the projects nature as a demonstration; this is not intended to be a complete product, the experience of seeing the beach balls; then applying boolean OR / AND searches on the balls is the complete work. Any who feel like continuing this project; or just using is as a starting point for something completely different are welcome to do so.


Development Environment
-----------------------
Unreal Engine 4.8.2
